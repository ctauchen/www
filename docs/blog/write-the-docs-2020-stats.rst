Write the Docs 2020 Stats
=========================

This year we have done a :doc:`/blog/2021-january-community-update` post along with our stats.
Check there for context around the community going into 2021.

2020 Stats
----------

We have shared our high-level community stats for the past 4 years,
and will continue to do it each year going forward.

You can read our previous posts from 2016_, 2017_, 2018_, and 2019_.

Conferences
~~~~~~~~~~~

* 600 attendees in Portland (up from 500)
* 325 attendees in Prague (up from 300)
* 125 attendees in Australia & India (up from 100)

Given the move to virtual conferences,
we were able to allow more people to attend this year.
We also experimented with a joint conference with Australia & India.
Working to bridge communities across distances is a major value of virtual events.


Slack Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* 11,350 :doc:`members </slack>` (up from 8,250)

Newsletters
~~~~~~~~~~~

* 8,225 :doc:`subscribers </newsletter>` (up from 7,386)

Meetups
~~~~~~~

* Over 10,000 members (too many to count)
* 50 :doc:`meetups </meetups/index>` (up from 46)

Podcast
~~~~~~~

* 32 :doc:`episodes </podcast>` total (up from 26)

Website
~~~~~~~

* 225,000 sessions (down from 250,000)
* 375,000 page views (down from 430,000)

The website numbers have been dropping a bit in recent years.
Generally this is because we are respecting Do Not Track preferences from our users,
which results in a 5-10% drop in numbers.
This means the website traffic is likely pretty stable,
but the measurement drops over time as more users set this setting.

GitHub
~~~~~~

* 1,321 commits_ to our repository (down from 1,955)
* 35 people_ who contributed to our repository (down from 56)

Thanks again
------------

All these numbers remind us of the scale and impact of our work.
Thanks again for being part of our journey.

To a better 2021,
