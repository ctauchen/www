Announcing ticket sales and CFP reminder for the Portland virtual conference
============================================================================

Happy new year, documentarians! We're excited to announce that tickets are on sale for our Portland virtual conference.
Following the success of the 2020 virtual conference, we look forward to more opportunities to bring the community together virtually and to share the wonderful energy with each other wherever you are in the world.

Get your ticket for the conference
----------------------------------

**The Portland conference will be held online on {{ date.short }}.** The `full event website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/>`_ is live, with some preliminary details, and we'll be filling in more as it gets closer.

If you're excited too, go ahead and `register for your ticket now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/tickets/>`_! We aren't sure exactly what capacity we will be able to hold for the virtual event, but we might still sell out to make sure we're providing a manageable event size for our attendees, as always.

Similar to last year's virtual conference, we're going to keep as much as possible of the spirit of the event alive:

* Excellent single track of pre-recorded presentations with moderated Q&A after each talk
* Writing Day
* Unconference sessions
* Job Fair
* Sponsor booths
* A virtual hallway track
* A social event of some kind, bring your own beverage and snacks :)

We really want to make sure that folks can get value from being at the event at the same time, and we think it will be another great year of helping our community connect.

Submit your talk by January 25th
--------------------------------

There are still a couple of weeks left to submit your proposal! Check out the `Call for Proposals page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/cfp/>`_ for more details about what we are looking for.

And if you already have an idea but you’re having a hard time getting your proposal to come together, you can always ask for feedback on the `Write the Docs Slack <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_. The community is there to help!

We’ll then be reviewing all the talk proposals, and will be contacting everyone who submitted a proposal by {{ cfp.notification }}.

Grant program
-------------

We updated our grant program application to take into account the virtual format of the event.
We're excited to be able to offer free tickets to a larger number of people this year, since there are now minimal other costs to attend the event.

You can apply by **{{ grants.ends }}** on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/opportunity-grants/>`_.

Support our community by sponsoring
-----------------------------------

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organizations and communities, who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.

We have published our `virtual sponsorship prospectus`_ for the conference,
and are open for new sponsorship inquiries.

.. _virtual sponsorship prospectus: https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/sponsors/prospectus/

We will still run the `job fair <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/job-fair/>`_, helping documentarians and organizations connect with each other. Check out the sponsorship prospectus for more details and to reserve your spot today.

Looking forward to seeing you all here soon, even though we won't be in person!
