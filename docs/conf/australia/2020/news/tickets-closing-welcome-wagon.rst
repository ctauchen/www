Ticket Sales Closing Soon and Welcome Wagon Guide
==================================================

G'day everyone!

We're just over a week away from the start of the conference,
and we're getting excited to invite you into our online venue for 2 days of content, collaboration, and conversation.
We will be closing ticket sales this **Friday, 27th November**, so if you've been on the fence, now is the time to buy one!

If you were hoping to come to this years event,
we recommend that you `get your tickets soon <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2020/tickets/>`_.

We have done our internal testing of the platform, and we're getting everything ready for prime time.
As part of our internal testing, we've built out the Welcome Wagon Guide.
This guide is our attempt to make sure that you get the most out of our events, and we've totally rewritten it for our online event.

Welcome Wagon Guide
-------------------

Each year we create a guide to help our attendees get the most out of the conference.
This year, we're all first-timers at an online event, so we've totally rewritten `our Welcome Wagon guide <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2020/welcome-wagon/>`_ to help you get the most out of our event this year.

We have a lot of information about how to use Hopin, and lots of tips and tricks for the best way to plan your days.

We've taken all the transit and travel information out, but please do plan to spend a large part of your day with us from the comfort of your own home.

Access to online platform
--------------------------

Once we close out our tickets, we plan to send everyone a link to access the Hopin event.
We plan to send this out by this weekend, to give everyone a few days to work through any troubleshooting issues that you might encounter.
The Hopin access links will be sent to all Ti.to ticketholders, so monitor your inbox later this week for a message.

If you don't get an email from us by the early next week, please email us and we'll help you out!
Once you've got your Hopin ticket, you will be ready to get started on Thursday morning!

Thanks so much to all our sponsors
